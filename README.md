# etl-dwh-medallion-arch
This project implements a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to build a scalable and efficient Data Warehouse using the Medallion Architecture pattern. The Medallion Architecture organizes data into multiple well-defined layers â€” Bronze (raw data), Silver (cleaned and enriched data), and Gold (curated, business-ready data).
